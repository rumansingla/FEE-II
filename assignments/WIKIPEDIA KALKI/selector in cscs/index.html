    <p>CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style. We can divide CSS selectors
        into five categories: Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class) Combinator selectors (select
        elements based on a specific relationship between them</p>

    <p>The asterisk (*) is known as the CSS universal selectors. It can be used to select any and all types of elements
        in an HTML page. The asterisk can also be followed by a selector while using to select a child object. This
        selector is useful when we want to select all the elements on the page.</p>
