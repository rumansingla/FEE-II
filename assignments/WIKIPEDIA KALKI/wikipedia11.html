                <mark>KALKI</mark> Kalki (Sanskrit: कल्कि), also called Kalkin,[1] is
                 the prophesied tenth and final incarnation of the god Vishnu. He is described
                  to appear in order to end the Kali Yuga, one of the four periods in the 
                  endless cycle of existence (Krita) in Vaishnava cosmology. The end of the 
                  Kali Yuga states this will usher in the new epoch of Satya Yuga in the cycle 
                  of existence, until the Mahapralaya (dissolution of the universe).[1][2]

                Kalki is described in the Puranas as the avatar who rejuvenates existence by 
                ending the darkest and destructive period to remove adharma (unrighteousness) 
                and ushering in the Satya Yuga, while riding a white horse with a fiery sword.[2] The description and details of Kalki are different among various Puranas. Kalki is also found in Buddhist texts, for example the Kalachakra-Tantra of Tibetan Buddhism.[11][12][13]
                
                The prophecy of the Kalki avatara is also told in Sikh texts.[14]

              <p>
                The name Kalki is derived from Kal, which means "time" (Kali Yuga).
                [15] The original term may have been Karki (white, from the horse) which morphed
                 into Kalki. This proposal is supported by two versions of Mahabharata manuscripts
                  (e.g. the G3.6 manuscript) that have been found,
                 where the Sanskrit verses name the incarnation to be karki.[1]

          <h2>Description</h2>
          Kalki is an avatara of Vishnu. Avatar means "descent", and refers to a descent
           of the divine into the material realm of human existence. The Garuda Purana 
           lists ten incarnations, with Kalki being the final one.[16] He is described as
            the incarnation who appears at the end of the Kali Yuga. He ends the darkest,
             degenerating, and chaotic stage of the Kali Yuga to remove adharma and ushers
              in the Satya Yuga, while riding a white horse with a fiery sword.[2][17] 
              He restarts a new cycle of time.[18] He is described as a Brahmin warrior
               in the Puranas.[2][17] It is mentioned in the Puranas that the immortal 
               Chiranjivis will assist him in various stages of his life.[19]
               Kalki appears for the first time in the Mahabharata.[20] A minor text named 
               Kalki Purana is a relatively recent text, likely composed in Bengal. Its dating 
               floruit is the 18th-century.[21] Wendy Doniger dates the Kalki Mythology containing
                Kalki Purana to between 1500 and 1700 CE.[22]

            Kalki appears for the first time in the great war epic Mahabharata.[20] The mention 
            of Kalki in the Mahabharata occurs only once, over the verses 3.188.85–3.189.6.[1] 
            The Kalki incarnation is found in the Maha Puranas such as Vishnu Purana,[37] Matsya
             Purana, and the Bhagavata Purana.[38][39] However, the details relating the Kalki 
             mythologies are divergent between the epic and the Puranas, as well as within the 
             Puranas.[40][20]

In the Mahabharata, according to Hiltebeitel, Kalki is an extension of the Parashurama 
incarnation
 legend, where a Brahmin warrior destroys Kshatriyas who were abusing their power to 
 spread chaos, evil, and the persecution of the powerless. The epic character of Kalki 
 restores dharma, restores justice in the world, but does not end the cycle of existence.[20][41] The Kalkin section in the Mahabharata is present in the Markandeya section. There, states Luis Reimann, can "hardly be any doubt that the Markandeya section is a late addition to the epic. Making Yudhishthira ask a question about conditions at the end of Kali and the beginning of Krta — something far removed from his own situation — is merely a device for justifying the inclusion of this subject matter in the epic."[42]

According to Cornelia Dimmitt, the "clear and tidy" systematization of Kalki and the 
remaining nine incarnations of Vishnu is not found in any of the Maha Puranas.[43] The
 coverage of Kalki in these Hindu texts is scant, in contrast to the legends of Matsya,
  Kurma, Varaha, Vamana, Narasimha, and Krishna, all of whom are repeatedly and extensively
   described. According to Dimmitt, this was likely because just like the concept of the
    Buddha as a Vishnu Incarnation, the concept of Kalki was "somewhat in flux" when the
     major Puranas were being compiled.[43]
